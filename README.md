# Transformations and Multiple Linear Regression

### Part 1: Transform data so that it best fits the linear model 
Performed diagnostics (QQ plot, Shapiro- Wilk normality test) to verify the assumptions of linear regression which were not met. Transformed data to correct for heteroskedasticity using Tukey transformation method

### Part 2:  Multiple Linear Regression

Determined what are the most significant variables. Built a multiple linear regression model using BIC selection criterion and interpreted the results. Conducted simultaneous CI’s. Not all of the categories of “type of sport” are significant in determining red blood cell count.
