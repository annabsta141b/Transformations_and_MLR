# Transformations and Multiple Linear Regression

### Part 1: Transformation 
Given data on our Y variable which is length of stay for a patient at the hospital in days and our
X variable which is average number of beds in hospital during study period, the goal for this
report is to transform the data so that it best fits the linear model.

### Part 2:  Multiple Linear Regression

Determine what are the most significant variables when modeling red blood cell count based on a patients physiological characteristics. Use stepwise selection to determine the most significant linear model based on the criterion of BIC
